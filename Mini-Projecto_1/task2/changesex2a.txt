Highlighted Changes and Justifications
Function Signature:

Change: Added b as an input parameter to the function Sim3A.
Justification: This allows the function to consider the bit error rate when estimating performance parameters.
Packet Corruption Check:

Change: Added a call to isPacketCorrupted(PacketSize, b) in the DEPARTURE case to check if the packet is corrupted.
Justification: This ensures that packets are checked for corruption due to bit errors before being counted as successfully transmitted.
Handling Corrupted Packets:

Change: If a packet is corrupted, it is counted as lost (LOSTPACKETS_DATA or LOSTPACKETS_VOIP is incremented).
Justification: This accurately reflects the impact of bit errors on packet loss.
Helper Function isPacketCorrupted:

Change: Added the isPacketCorrupted function to determine if a packet is corrupted based on the bit error rate b.
Justification: This function encapsulates the logic for determining packet corruption, making the main simulation loop cleaner and more modular.
